# Tarjan

Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm is an algorithm in graph theory for finding the **strongly connected components (SCCs)** of a directed graph. It runs in linear time, matching the time bound for alternative methods including Kosaraju's algorithm and the path-based strong component algorithm. The algorithm is named for its inventor, Robert Tarjan.
