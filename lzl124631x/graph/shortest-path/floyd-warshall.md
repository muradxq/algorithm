# Floyd Warshall

Floyd-Warshall algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shorted paths **between all pairs of vertices** in a weighted directed graph with positive or negative edge weights \(but no negative cycles\).

Floyd-Warshall algorithm and Bellman-Ford algorithm are both DP algorithms. Floyd-Warshall tries every **vertice** for each pair of vertices to find the shortest path between the vertice pair, while Bellman-Ford tries every **edge** `V-1` times to find the shortest path between a specific source node to all other nodes.

## Algorithm

For each vertice `n`, try to use it to update the min distance between each vertice pair `u, v`.

The time complexity is `O(V^3)`. The space complexity is `O(V^2)`.

The following is the Floyd-Warshall algorithm application on [1334. Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance \(Medium\)](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-city-with-the-smallest-number-of-neighbors-at-a-threshold-distance/).

The distances are initialized as `1e6` because there are at most 100 nodes and each edge at most weights `10^4`, so the maximum path weight won't exceed `10^6`.

            int cnt = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (d[i][j] <= k) ++cnt;
            }
            if (cnt <= minCnt) {
                minCnt = cnt;
                ans = i;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Path reconstruction

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm typically only provides the lengths of the paths between all pairs of vertices. We can nodify it to reconstruct the path for between any two endpoint vertices.

```text
let dist be a |V| * |V| array of minimum distances initialized to Infinity
let next be a |V| * |V| array of vertex indices initialized to null

procedure FloydWarshallWithPathReconstruction() is
    for each edge (u, v) do
        dist[u][v] ← w(u, v)  // The weight of the edge (u, v)
        next[u][v] ← v
    for each vertex v do
        dist[v][v] ← 0
        next[v][v] ← v
    for k from 1 to |V| do // standard Floyd-Warshall implementation
        for i from 1 to |V|
            for j from 1 to |V|
                if dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] then
                    dist[i][j] ← dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]
                    next[i][j] ← next[i][k]
procedure Path(u, v)
    if next[u][v] = null then
        return []
    path = [u]
    while u ≠ v
        u ← next[u][v]
        path.append(u)
    return path
```
